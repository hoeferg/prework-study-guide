# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide created for the University of Arizona coding bootcamp prework. This website covers HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript basics. The notes include vocabulary for each language and command codes for each language. This was created to be used as a reference for when class begins. The student can refer to the guide to make sure they review what they need to code. They can also add to the website as more topics are covered in class. This will help students remember what they have learned in the prework.

Through creating this project, the creater was able to have an introduction into the four coding languages, as well as an introduction to how the class will be ran. It gave them their first experiance with coding and a basis to build off of.
